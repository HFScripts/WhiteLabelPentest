\n
## Overview\n
\n
Our tool performs various checks, scans, and analyses on your website, identifying potential security leaks, common files, scanned ports, and subdomains, among other things. It further evaluates technologies employed on the site and produces a PDF report for easy interpretation and actioning.\n
\n
## Features\n
\n
- Database leak identification\n
- Subdomain discovery\n
- Cloudflare usage analysis\n
- Technology scanning\n
- Wordpress site identification\n
- Common files and directory exposure analysis\n
- Port scanning\n
- Parameter discovery and testing\n
- Generation of comprehensive PDF reports\n
\n
## How to Use\n
\n
\`\`\`python\n
# First, import the necessary modules\n
import os\n
from utils.pdfgeneration.dynamic_text import *\n
from utils.scripts.function_management import *\n
from reportlab.lib.styles import getSampleStyleSheet\n
from utils.pdfgeneration.pdfreport import PDFDocument\n
from utils.scripts.functions import generate_security_rating_bar\n
from utils.pdfgeneration.pdf_elements import PasswordTableElement\n
from reportlab.platypus import Paragraph, Spacer, PageBreak, Image\n
from utils.pdfgeneration.style_data import style_table, create_styles, create_image_elements\n
\n
# Specify the domain for the site you want to test\n
domain = "your-site.net"\n
comp_email="your-email@company.com"\n
comp_name="Your Company Name"\n
logo_url='https://your-logo-url.jpg'\n
logo_backup='https://your-logo-backup-url.jpg'\n
API_KEY = 'your-api-key'\n
\n
# Run the penetration testing function with your parameters\n
leaked_database_entries, all_subdomains_identified, technology_scan_output, live_domains_from_technology_scan, cloudflare_enabled, cloudflare_disabled, wordpress_sites, non_wordpress_sites, common_files_found, parameters_found, parameter_filenames, scanned_ports = fake_functions_to_run(domain, API_KEY)\n
\n
# Generate the PDF report with your results\n
test_pdf_func(domain, comp_email, comp_name, logo_url, logo_backup, leaked_database_entries, all_subdomains_identified, technology_scan_output, live_domains_from_technology_scan, cloudflare_enabled, cloudflare_disabled, wordpress_sites, non_wordpress_sites, common_files_found, parameters_found, parameter_filenames, scanned_ports)\n
\n
# Delete the logo file and cleanup leftover output files\n
if os.path.exists("logo.jpg"):\n
    os.remove("logo.jpg")\n
png_files = glob.glob('output*')\n
for filename in png_files:\n
    os.remove(filename)\n
